## Stock-Market-Neural-Network
Built a Long Short Term Memory neural network with a linear regression layer to predict stock price movements. Program takes data from AlphaVantage API and uses it to train the model on various stocks. Tested against LASSO, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted models to identify model with highest predictive power. Included example of American Airlines Stock but can be used for any stock.

## Details:

# Tech: Python (Libraries include Pandas, Numpy, SKLearn, TensorFlow)
# Concepts: Time Series, Neural Networks, Linear Regression

## Optimizations Implemented

## Lessons Learned:

I was able to implement technqiues like a neural netowkr and linear regression from my Coursera Machine Learning specialization and create a project about predicting stock prices. I really enjoyed working on a fintech project and hope to create more machine learning projects within the fintech space. I also learned more about various data sources and how to modify datasets so they can be fed into learning models. I really enjoyed working on this project, and I am planning on working on a similiar project where I use rainfall data to predict commodities price movements.
