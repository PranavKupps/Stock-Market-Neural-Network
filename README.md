## Stock-Market-Neural-Network
Built a Long Short Term Memory neural network with a linear regression layer to predict stock price movements. Program takes data from AlphaVantage API and uses it to train the model on various stocks. Included example of American Airlines Stock but can be used for any stock.

## Details:

# Tech: Python (Libraries include Pandas, Numpy, SKLearn, TensorFlow)
# Concepts: Time Series, Neural Networks, Linear Regression

## Optimizations Implemented

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
